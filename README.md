Step-1:Portfolio Allocation and Sharpe ratio- 
     [1]Portfolio Allocation- Portfolio allocation refers to the distribution of investment capital across different assets or securities in order to achieve specific investment objectives. The goal is to create a diversified portfolio that balances risk and return based on the investor's preferences, goals, and risk tolerance.
     [2]Sharpe ratio- Sharpe, is a measure of risk-adjusted performance for an investment or a portfolio. It quantifies the excess return per unit of risk and is widely used to assess the efficiency of an investment strategy.

step-2:Portfolio Optimization -Portfolio optimization is a process in financial management that involves constructing an investment portfolio with the aim of achieving the highest possible return for a given level of risk or, conversely, minimizing risk for a target level of return. The goal is to find the most efficient allocation of assets in a way that maximizes the portfolio's expected return while considering the associated level of risk.

Step-3: CAPM(capital asset pricing model)- The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model that establishes a linear relationship between the expected return of an asset and its systematic risk, often measured by beta. CAPM is widely used in finance to estimate the expected return on an investment based on its risk.
