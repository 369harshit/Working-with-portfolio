Portfolio Allocation and Sharpe ratio | Portfolio Optimization | CAPM

Step-1:Portfolio Allocation and Sharpe ratio- 
     [1]Portfolio Allocation- Portfolio allocation refers to the distribution of investment capital across different assets or securities in order to achieve specific investment objectives. The goal is to create a diversified portfolio that balances risk and return based on the investor's preferences, goals, and risk tolerance.
     [2]Sharpe ratio- Sharpe, is a measure of risk-adjusted performance for an investment or a portfolio. It quantifies the excess return per unit of risk and is widely used to assess the efficiency of an investment strategy.

step-2:Portfolio Optimization -Portfolio optimization is a process in financial management that involves constructing an investment portfolio with the aim of achieving the highest possible return for a given level of risk or, conversely, minimizing risk for a target level of return. The goal is to find the most efficient allocation of assets in a way that maximizes the portfolio's expected return while considering the associated level of risk.

Step-3: CAPM(capital asset pricing model)- The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model that establishes a linear relationship between the expected return of an asset and its systematic risk, often measured by beta. CAPM is widely used in finance to estimate the expected return on an investment based on its risk.


*****Requirements*****
Portfolios are a way to diversify the investor funds. This part of the assignment student will download five stocks monthly data from yahoo finance and compute the monthly return on the basis of Adjusted Close price. In addition, the Covariance matrix should be computed for the five stocks selected. 

Part-A:
[1]-	Selection of five stocks, traded on Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) or National Stock Exchange (NSE) and download of prices monthly data last five years, use Adjusted close column in yahoo finance
[2]	Computation of Returns and Covariance matrix, and Beta for each of the five stocks selected in [1]         

Part-B: Compute Portfolio Characteristics			
[1] Create 100 portfolios with random numbers and compute the portfolio mean and portfolio Standard Deviation and Sharpe Ratio for each portfolio
[2] Perform Descriptive statistics and plot graph for data in B.1.1   
[3] Compute Optimized portfolio weights and Sharpe Ratio weights 
[4] For each of the risk levels (up 10 risk levels), find the weights for maximum return, given a risk level (vary the risk level and use Solver) to obtain optimal weights for each of the risk levels selected â€“ Upto 10 maximum risk levels can be selected, minimum 7 risk levels to be selected.	              

[5] Compute the weights for the Optimized Sharpe Ratio (Sharpe ratio should be maximized)
